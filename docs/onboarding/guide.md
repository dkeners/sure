## 1. Creating your Sure Account

*(Steps here - to be added)*

The next sections of this guide go over how to manually add accounts and transactions to your account in Sure. If you would like to use one of Sure's integrations with a data provider you can reference one of the following guides here:

- SimpleFin (WIP)

## 2. Accout Types in Sure

Sure supports several account types, which are grouped into **Assets** (things you own) and **Debts/Liabilities** (things you owe):

| Assets      | Debts/Liabilities |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Cash        | Credit Card       |
| Investment  | Loan              |
| Crypto      | Other Liability   |
| Property    |                   |
| Vehicle     |                   |
| Other Asset |                   |

 

## 3. How Asset Accounts Work

Cash, checking and savings accounts **increase** when you add money and **decrease** when you spend.

Example:

- Starting balance: $500

- Add an expense of $20 -> balance is now \$480

- Add an income of \$100 -> balance is now \$580



## 4. How Debt Accounts Work (Liabilities)

Liability accounts track how much you **owe**, so the math can feel *backwards* compared to an asset account.

**Key rule:**

- **Positive Balances** = you owe money

- **Negative balances** = the bank owes *you* (e.g. overpayment or refund)

**Transactions behave like this:**

- **Expenses** (negative amounts) => increase your debt (you owe more)

- **Payments or refunds** (positive amounts) => decrease your debt (you owe less)

Credit Card example:

1. Balance: **$200 owed**

2. Spend \$20 => You now owe \$220 (balance goes *up* in red)

3. Pay off \$50 => You now owe \$170 (balance goes *down* in green)

Overpayment Example:

1. Balance: -\$44 (bank owes you \$44)

2. Spend \$1 => Bank now owes you **$43** (balance shown as -\$43, moving towards zero)



> [!TIP]
> Why does it work this way? This matches standard accounting and what your credit card provider shows online. Think of a liability balance as "**Amount Owed**", not "available cash."

 

## 5. Quick Reference: Asses vs. L:iability Behavior

| Action           | Asset Account (e.g. Checking) | Liability Account (e.g. Credit Card) |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Spend \$20       | Balance ↓ \$20                | Balance ↑ \$20 (more debt)           |
| Receive \$50     | Balance ↑ \$50                | Balance ↓\$50 (less debt)            |
| Negative Balance | Overdraft                     | Bank owes *you* money                |
